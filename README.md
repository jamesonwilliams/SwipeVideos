# Tinder for the Job Market

## Problem

Job postings are outdated. Today's job posts are filled with
boilerplate. They're cold and impersonal. They don't represent your
brand, culture, or purpose.

## Solution

Candidates can watch a short video pitch about your team and open role.
Candidates can swipe left or right to pass or show interest.

Candidates match with perspective employers based on interest, and
qualifications entered in their profiles.

See a (choppy, pre-alpha quality) video grab from the Android emulator,
running this app.
